The purpose of this challenge was to see the earthquake data in relation to the location of the tectonic plates on the earth.

# Resources

The map shows all earthquake data and where all tectonic plates are located around the world over the past 7 days. Also, you can view the magnitude and the location of where the earthquake occurred by clicking the circles that represents an earthquake.
